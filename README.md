# Education

Education topics can encompass a wide range of areas, including, but not limited to:
- Educational institutions (Where does society learn?)
- Educational theory (What methods effectively educate society?)
- Educational logistics (How do we effectively, if at all, educate society?)
- Educational relevance (Does forward-reaching-education or learn-as-you-go work best?)
